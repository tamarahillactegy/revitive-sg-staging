	<p>Medical device classification is part of the systems regulating the marketing of Medical Devices. Regulatory Guidance states that the risk presented by a particular medical device depends substantially on its intended purpose and the effectiveness of the risk management techniques applied during design, manufacture and use. Other considerations include its intended user(s), its mode of operation and the technology used. The factors influencing device classification include the duration of medical device contact with the body, the degree of invasiveness, whether the medical device delivers medicinal products or energy to the patient, whether they are intended to have a biological affect on the patient and local versus systemic effects, etc. General Medical Devices can be classified as Class A, B, C or D.
