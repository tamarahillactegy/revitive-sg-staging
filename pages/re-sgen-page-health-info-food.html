	<p>The following foods are thought to help healthy circulation</p>
	<h3>Cayenne pepper</h3>

	<h3>Oranges</h3>
	<p>Oranges and other citrus fruits high vitamin C are natural blood thinners and are said to strengthen capillary walls and prevent plaque build-up which leads to <a href="{{store url="health-information/poor-circulation/"}}">poor circulation</a>.</p>
	<h3>Dark Chocolate</h3>
	<p>Cocoa contains flavonoids which is naturally found in plants and fruits and has been well linked to improving blood circulation. A study published in the Circulation Journal showed that dark chocolate rich in natural flavonoids improved blood circulation when compared with white chocolate with no flavonoids.</p>
	<h3>Sunflower seeds</h3>
	<p>Sunflower seeds are rich in vitamin E which is shown to help keep blood clots from forming. They are great at helping improve circulation. Likewise so are foods such as olives, nuts and pumpkin seeds,</p>
	<h3>Root Ginger</h3>
	<p>Ginger is known for helping nausea and digestion problems as well as increasing blood circulation. Ginger can be eaten raw or added to foods or why not try ginger tea.</p>
	<h3>Garlic</h3>
	<p>Garlic has many uses and one of them is it cleanses the blood and helps prevent plaque build-up. Other foods in the bulb group such as radishes, onions and leeks are also good at stimulating blood flow.</p>
	<h3>Ginkgo Biloba</h3>
	<p>One of the world's oldest surviving tree species, Ginkgo biloba dilates blood vessels and in doing so increases blood flow. It is also thought to increase blood flow to the brain.</p>
	<h3>Goji Berries</h3>
	<p>Goji berries can be found in natural health stores and look similar to raisins. They are high in fibre to help boost the immune system as well as increasing blood circulation.</p>
	<h3>Watermelon</h3>
	<p>Watermelons are rich in lycopene which is a natural antioxidant linked to improving circulation. Lycopene is a natural pigment which gives certain foods their reddish colour. Tomatoes, pink grapefruit and apricots also contain lycopene.</p>
	<h3>Salmon and avocados</h3>
	<p>Both salmon and avocados contain heart-healthy omega 3 fatty acids which research has shown to support the cardiovascular system and increase blood circulation.</p>
