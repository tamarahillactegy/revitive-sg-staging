	<p>Cold hands and feet are very common conditions that can affect people of all ages. Over 60&rsquo;s are more vulnerable to cold hands and feet as the skin thins and joints suffer from stiffness.</p>
	<p>Cold hands and feet occur due to the body&rsquo;s response to cold temperatures. The body will reduce the blood flow to these extremities which leave the hands and feet cold. The body is trying to protect itself by keeping the blood in the main arteries of the body. This commonly happens during winter when the temperature drops and people may be sitting for long periods in cold and draughty homes.</p>
	<h2>How to improve cold hands and feet</h2>
