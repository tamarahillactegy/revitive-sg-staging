	<h1 style="font-size: 28px;">Revitive is proven to increase blood circulation</h1>
	<p>Since 2007 we have worked with leading UK Universities and invested in a number of clinical studies to build a foundation of research which proves that Revitive does what is says on the box.</p>

		<li>Revitive is the only device of its kind proven to increase circulation, relieve aches and pains and reduce swelling.</li>
		<li>Compared to 20 minutes of heel toe raises Revitive is as least or better at increasing circulation</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Revitive Results</h2>
	<p>In our latest study in December 2011, the Human Performance Centre at London South Bank University completed an applied research study. They looked at the effect of <a href="{{store url="health-information/poor-circulation/"}}">poor circulation</a> from inactivity and how Revitive can relieve these symptoms. Participants taking part in the study were regarded as healthy individuals and were asked to remain quietly seated for 40 minutes. Following these 40 minutes the participants showed significant signs of poor circulation (cold, painful, swollen ankles, feet and lower legs). The study compared 20 minutes of using Revitive to 20 minutes of continuous heel toe raises. Results showed that after using Revitive the participants&rsquo; symptoms of poor circulation were alleviated, and Revitive was at least or even more efficient at resolving <a href="{{store url="health-information/swollen-ankles/"}}">swelling </a>and circulation insufficiencies than heel toe raises.&nbsp; All participants found 20 minutes of heel toe raises very boring whereas using the Revitive for 20 minutes was enjoyable and soothing.</p>

	<p>Healthy volunteers participated in this study, which was approved by the London South Bank University Research Ethics Committee, and conducted in compliance with the World Medical Association&rsquo;s Declaration of Helsinki (2008).</p>
