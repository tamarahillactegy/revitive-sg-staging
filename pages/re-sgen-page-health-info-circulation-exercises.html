	<p>Exercising is important to help maintain healthy circulation. Here we look at some exercises which could help improve circulation&hellip;</p>
	<h3>Walking</h3>
	<p>Waking is one of the best exercises for people of all ages. Walking makes the muscles in the legs contract and relax and this action in what pumps the blood around the body. Walking is a low impact exercise which also lowers blood pressure. Start by short walks 2 or 3 times a week.</p>
	<h3>Swimming</h3>
	<p>Swimming has the least impact on the joints and is safe and easy on the body as it is a non-weight bearing exercise. Swimming works the entire body and improves oxygen flow to the heart and lungs. People of any age and fitness level can swim and it is a gentle workout for those suffering from joint and muscle pain.</p>
	<h3>Yoga</h3>
	<p>Yoga requires controlled breathing and this type of breathing oxygenates the blood and helps it flow deeper into the muscles improving circulation. Yoga has varying levels of difficulty but has something for everyone.</p>
	<h3>Cycling</h3>
	<p>Cycling is great for improving circulation in the lower body and can be done outside or in the gym.</p>
	<h3>Dancing</h3>
	<p>Dancing might not be a daily exercise but is great for improving circulation across the whole body.</p>
	<h3>Heel-toe raises</h3>
	<p>Heel-toe raises are good for getting the blood pumping again when you feel numbness, tingling or pain in your feet. Sit with your knees at a 90-degree angle to the floor. Then raise your toes from the floor keeping your heels on the ground. Next place your foot flat back on the floor again. Repeat this one foot at a time, and then try doing both at the same time, finally transitioning to a rocking motion of a heel-toe pattern.</p>
	<h3>Hand exercises</h3>
	<p>It is just as common to have poor circulation in the hands as it is the feet. Take each hand and extend the fingers outward so they are all sprawled out. Then make a fist, hold for a few seconds and stretch fingers outward again. This will keep the hands and fingers from cramping up and allow for better circulation.</p>
	<h3>Spot marching</h3>
	<p>Start by marching on the spot for 20 marches; keep your shoulders pulled back, back straight and stomach muscles pulled in. Continue marching, adding shoulder rolls; simply lift both shoulders up to your ears, then back and forwards, 20 times.</p>
